2. final resutl: 20
3. values added: 20
4. This will return an error because result is only defined in the let block, and therefore, once we leave the let block, result is no longer defined.
5. values added: 0. There will be an error on line 7 because result is supposed to be a constant variable so when we try to change it, javascript will not allow us to do so. 
6. There will still be an error from line 7 but there will also be the same error from question 4 because result will only be defined inside of the if block.
